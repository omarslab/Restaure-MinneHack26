# Restaure (Flutter)

Restaure is a location-based mobile app designed to restore visibility and engagement for small businesses in Minneapolis.
Instead of letting struggling local businesses lose attention and revenue, our app highlights them and encourages real-world support through discovery, rewards, and community interaction.

Our project directly aligns with the “Mending Over Ending” theme by using technology to mend local economic engagement rather than allowing small businesses to be forgotten.
